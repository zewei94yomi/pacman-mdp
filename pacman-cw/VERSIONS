Which version of the KCL 6CCS3AIN/7CCSMAIN practical code is this?

Version 1.0

 Original version for the labs in week 1

Version 1.1

 Removed a few files from the folder to simplify things.

Version 1.2

 Modified api.py to include a function that returns the set of legal
 actions. This means (I thnk) that all access to the state of the game
 in the sample agents is now through the functions in api.py (and so
 you can write code that fits the specification which requires this).

 Note, this change makes this version of sampleAgents *incompatible*
 with the old version of api.py.

Version 1.3

Added a new layout, mediumClassicNoGhosts, which has no ghosts. Handy
for devleopment.
