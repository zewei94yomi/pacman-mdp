#
# Some simple agents to work with the PacMan AI projects from:
#
# http://ai.berkeley.edu/
#
# These use a simple API that allow us to control Pacman's interaction with
# the environment adding a layer on top of the AI Berkeley code.
#
# As required by the licensing agreement for the PacMan AI we have:

# Licensing Information:  You are free to use or extend these projects for
# educational purposes provided that (1) you do not distribute or publish
# solutions, (2) you retain this notice, and (3) you provide clear

#
# A tiny bit more sophisticated. Having picked a direction, keep going
# until that direction is no longer possible. Then make a random
# choice.
