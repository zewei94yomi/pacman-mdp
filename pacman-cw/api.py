# With acknowledgements to Jiaming Ke, who was the first to report the

#
# An API for use with the PacMan AI projects from:
#
# http://ai.berkeley.edu/
#
# This provides a simple way of controlling the way that Pacman moves
# and senses its world, to permit exercises with limited sensing
# ability and nondeterminism in sensing and action.
